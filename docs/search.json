    "text": "ggplot2 is notable in the data visualization space. Its elegance and flexibility as well as its track-record of being well-maintained makes it a attractive tool for researchers, business professionals, journalists, educators and the like.\nggplot2 lets users ‘write their plots into existence’. Users identify required plot components, name those elements, and ggplot2 produces the described plot. Code tends to be concise and intuitive, and it provides a faithful record of inputs and specification of a rendered plot.\nExtending ggplot2 is a powerful way to enhance productivity and make plot coding more fluid and enjoyable. Given this, it’s surprising just how limited some quite useful extension mechanism are — even among seasoned ggplot2 users. It has been warned, for example, ‘Extending ggplot2 … is not for the faint-hearted’.1 This state of affairs is unfortunate, but we think this reality doesn’t need to persist with greater sustained and focused attention to educational resources for potential extenders.\n‘everyday ggplot2 extension’ is born out of (2020-present). It’s goal is to provide education materials that will meet potential extenders where they and provide a community of support in extension endeavors. In short, this project seeks to support a new wave of extenders.2\n\n\n‘Everyday’ is meant in the sense of ordinary – your ggplot2 extension doesn’t need to be flashy or complicated.\n‘Everyday’ is also meant in the sense of frequent. Practicing ggplot2 extension will probably make you better at extension - you’ll be in a position to write that next handy extension once when you have more experience under your belt. We’ve got some bite-sized exercises for you to build your know-how.\nFurthermore, we model how to use extension mechanisms on the day-to-day. I.e. on-the-fly and in script use. (For those who are eventually interested in packaging, the project seeks to support best practice in that area as well - workshop to come).\n\n\n\nBy now, if you happen to know the book ‘The Design of Everyday Things’, you may be thinking our title evokes that work. That’s correct. An aim is to design new avenues for bringing people into ggplot2 extension.\nAnd it’s to be expected that we’ll make poorly designed ggplot2 extensions along the way. And this is fine since mistakes can sometimes be more instructive and memorable than doing things ‘the right way’ the first time round. It’s hard to imagine Norman’s book selling as well without the ill-conceived tea kettle gracing the cover. In fact the ‘Norman door’ is one whose design makes door-use difficult. Expecting mistakes is another reason to make ggplot2 extension a less out-of-the-ordinary experience; past extensions feel less precious and we can part ways with them if appropriate. A deprecated package or abandoned function may have been of great service in getting you to a place that’s more sensible."

Teun van den Brand has also been helpful and open to discussion about about technical aspects of particular extension questions.\nI’m indebted to the ggplot2 extenders meet-up presenters and participants, that have provided a wealth of insight about extension experiences.\nIn the future anticipate Denver R-Ladies to be a resource for candid, person-to-person feedback. We recently relaunched the group and I anticipate interest in the topic of ggplot2 extension, and might help host proposed workshops that are part of this proposal.\nAndrew Heiss has promised to help with a workshop aimed at packaging new ggplot2 extension functionality which is part of this proposal. Other expert package builders (especially in ggplot2 extension) will be recruited."

    "text": "Consulted\nI’m grateful to the ASA Colorado-Wyoming Chapter membership for helpful feedback at the October 2023 meeting, after giving the talk: Supporting a new wave of ggplot2 extenders: New points of entry for ggplot2 super-users.\nI’ve also grateful to colleagues at West Point Math Department for their feedback on my talk about creating and using new Stats objects: ‘Unlocking ggplot2 as a computational engine by extending ggplot2 statistical geometries’\nFurthermore, I’ve gained feedback from participants evaluating a new tutorial to Stat extension, easy geom (Stat) recipes. A survey and focus group was used to hear their reactions. In brief, I found that the recruited ggplot2 super users (regular users with several years of experience), either hadn’t tried to enter the Stat extension space, or felt it was quite challenging. But there was a high success rates for new Stat creation using the new tutorial’s recipes model. Participant characteristics and tutorial evaluation can be found here. West Point Cadet Morgan Brown assisted in writing the tutorial."
