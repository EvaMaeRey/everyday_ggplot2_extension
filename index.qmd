# Why *Everyday ggplot2 extension?*

`ggplot2` is notable in the data visualization space. Its elegance and flexibility as well as its track-record of being well-maintained makes it a attractive tool for researchers, business professionals, journalists, educators and the like.

`ggplot2` lets users 'write their plots into existence'. Users identify required plot components, name those elements, and ggplot2 produces the described plot. Code tends to be concise and intuitive, and it provides a faithful record of inputs and specification of a rendered plot. 

*Extending* ggplot2 is a powerful way to enhance productivity and make plot coding more fluid and enjoyable. Given this, it's surprising just how limited some quite useful extension mechanism are — even among seasoned ggplot2 users. It has been warned, for example, 'Extending `ggplot2` ... is not for the faint-hearted'.[^1] This state of affairs is unfortunate, but we think this reality doesn't need to persist with greater sustained and focused attention to educational resources for potential extenders.

'everyday ggplot2 extension' is born out of  (2020-present). It's goal is to provide education materials that will meet potential extenders where they and provide a community of support in extension endeavors. In short, this project seeks to support a new wave of extenders.[^2]

## Extension for mere mortals (everyday users)

'Everyday' is meant in the sense of *ordinary* -- your ggplot2 extension doesn't need to be flashy or complicated.

'Everyday' is also meant in the sense of *frequent*. Practicing ggplot2 extension will probably make you better at extension - you'll be in a position to write that next handy extension once when you have more experience under your belt. We've got some bite-sized exercises for you to build your know-how.

Furthermore, we model how to use extension mechanisms on the day-to-day. I.e. on-the-fly and in script use. (For those who are eventually interested in packaging, the project seeks to support best practice in that area as well - workshop to come).

## Support through missteps and hurdles


By now, if you happen to know the book 'The Design of Everyday Things', you may be thinking our title evokes that work. That's correct. An aim is to design new avenues for bringing people into ggplot2 extension.

And it's to be expected that we'll make poorly designed ggplot2 extensions along the way. And this is fine since mistakes can sometimes be more instructive and memorable than doing things 'the right way' the first time round. It's hard to imagine Norman's book selling as well without the ill-conceived tea kettle gracing the cover. In fact the 'Norman door' is one whose design makes door-use difficult. Expecting mistakes is another reason to make ggplot2 extension a less out-of-the-ordinary experience; past extensions feel less precious and we can part ways with them if appropriate. A deprecated package or abandoned function may have been of great service in getting you to a place that's more sensible.

```{r, include = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = F, echo = F, warning = F)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("design_of_everyday_things.jpg")
```

```{r, eval = F}
library(ggstamp)
library(ggplot2)
ggcanvas() + 
  stamp_polygon(x0y0 = pos_honeycomb(n = 9), 
                fill = "darkgoldenrod1") + 
  stamp_text(label = c("ggxmean", "ggstamp", "ggols", 
                       "ggsample", "ggcalendar", 
                       "ggchalkb...", "ggquiet", "ggcirclepack",
                       "ggdirect"), 
             xy = pos_honeycomb(n = 9), size = 5) +
  labs(title = "trying stuff out in ggplot2 extension",
       subtitle = "honeycombs are surprisingly strong structures",
       caption = "expert and experiment have the same latin root: 'experi', to try") 

```

# How do I know there's an opportunity for extension?

The reason ggplot2 exists is explained by Hadley Wickham in an interview:

> And, you know, I'd get a dataset. And, *in my head I could very clearly kind of picture*, I want to put this on the x-axis. Let's put this on the y-axis, draw a line, put some points here, break it up by this variable. And then, like, getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it's just really, really hard. Just, like, felt harder than it should be... Where I just felt like ... [should just be able] to say *this is what I'm thinking, this is how I'm picturing this plot. Like you're the computer 'Go and do it'.* - <https://www.trifacta.com/podcast/tidy-data-with-hadley-wickham/>

Born out of this frustration and knowedge of Leland Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics, ggplot2 was built with its 'logically decomposed bits', which generally lets you fly through plot creation with ease. You can go from the plot you've already pictured in your head into reality simply by describing it.

After a good amount of time using ggplot2, you get used to this flying sensation. You've practiced and mastered the grammar. You are a composer of 'graphical poems' --- how the 2010 introductory paper on ggplot2 describes the code for the plot compositions. You confidently speak plots into existence. Poetry slam!

```{r, fig.cap="*The 'daring young man on the flying trapeze', Jules Leotard, who 'flies through the air with the greatest of ease'*"}
knitr::include_graphics("jules_leotard.jpeg", )
```

But then one day you may find yourself with a loss for graphical words within ggplot2. At some point ggplot2 will seem to *fail* to give you the fluid ggplot2 experience. One day you will find yourself saying, 'Why aren't I flying?" This might be a moment to double-check your grammar prowess; or it might be a moment to turn to ggplot2 extension!

You may find what you need among existing extensions, checking the [extensions gallery](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) and the [Awesome `ggplot2`](https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-ggplot2) repository, you can't find what you need to fly again, you might consider creating your own extension.

To summarize, here are some situations that indicate there might be a ggplot2 extension opportunity:

-   I don't feel like I'm flying; but usually I do
-   My brain hurts because of the plot I'm trying to build; but usually it's happy or
-   'getting that vision out of my head, and into reality, it’s just really, really hard... harder than it should be.'
-   my amygdala is activated when I think about making a certain plot

```{r, echo = F}
library(gganatogram)
gganatogram(data=hgFemale_key, outline = T, 
            fillOutline='#a6bddb', 
            organism='human', sex='female', fill="colour")  +
  ggstamp::stamp_wash(alpha = .8) +
  geom_polygon(data = hgFemale_list$brain, aes(x = x, y = -y), 
            fill = "red") +
  coord_equal() + 
  ggstamp::stamp_text_ljust(label = "Ouch!", angle = 5)

# brainstorming a stamp (annotation) layer for the brain...
stamp_female_brain <- function(...){
  
    geom_polygon(data = hgFemale_list$brain, aes(x = x, y = -y),...)
  # could be polygon
  
}
```

# A new 'easy recipes' approach to creating and using new Stats: Taste, succeed, minimally modify

layer extension recipes take the form:

-   Step 0. Get the job done with 'base' ggplot2. It's a good idea to clarify what needs to happen without getting into the extension architecture

-   Step 1. Write a computation function. Wrap the necessary computation into a function.

-   Step 2. Define a ggproto object. ggproto objects allow your extension to work together with base ggplot2 functions! You'll use the computation function from step 1 to help define it.

-   Step 3. Write your geom/stat\_\* function! You're ready to write your function. You will incorporate the ggproto from step 2.

-   Step 4. Test/Enjoy! Take your new geom for a spin! Check out group-wise computation behavior!

# Communities of practice



Communities of practice can help motivate and sustain productivity of projects.

-   [ggplot2 extenders](https://github.com/teunbrand/ggplot-extension-club) has met since

-   [discussion](https://github.com/teunbrand/ggplot-extension-club/discussions) Extenders can share their good ideas which maybe they don't have quite the skills or knowledge to execute on; or maybe they are just missing a comma! The [ggproto](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggproto) tag on StackOverflow is similar but might be dominated by more advanced users.)

-   stalwarts; long-time ggplot2 extenders and developers

'everyday ggplot2 extension' would like to point you to new communities of practice -- places were you can share work and frustrations in the ggplot2 world:

-   warming up; \[<https://github.com/teunbrand/ggplot-extension-club>\]

I'm hopeful that an 'absolute newcomers' group may develop; this could consist of ggplot2 super-users, no extension experience [tutorial evaluation is underway and focus group may seed absolute newcomers group](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/easy-geom-recipes) and their collaborators (is it cool and fun to explore the ggplot2 extension space w/ absolute newcomers *to ggplot2 and R* - yes it is!). It might spin off of the focus groups for the 'easy geom recipes' evaluation.

'everyday ggplot2 extension' promotes the 'warming up' group and aspires to serve an 'absolute newcomers' group; and to promote cross pollination between groups.

-   [ggpuzzles](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggpuzzles) is a place to demo minimal not-yet-working examples.

## Contributors

Especially notably in willingness to have conversations about how to make Stat extension more accessible is June Choe; he also has been very open to technical discussion and has played an especially large role in my fluency in using delayed aesthetic evaluation. Teun van den Brand has also been helpful and open to discussion about about technical aspects of particular extension questions.

I'm indebted to the [ggplot2 extenders meet-up](https://github.com/teunbrand/ggplot-extension-club/blob/main/README.md) presenters and participants, that have provided a wealth of insight about extension experiences.

In the future anticipate Denver R-Ladies to be a resource for candid, person-to-person feedback. We recently [relaunched](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-denver/events/299879858/) the group and I anticipate interest in the topic of ggplot2 extension, and might help host proposed workshops that are part of this proposal.

[Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) has promised to help with a workshop aimed at packaging new ggplot2 extension functionality which is part of this proposal. Other expert package builders (especially in ggplot2 extension) will be recruited.

## Consulted

I'm grateful to the ASA Colorado-Wyoming Chapter membership for helpful feedback at the October 2023 meeting, after giving the talk: [Supporting a new wave of ggplot2 extenders: New points of entry for ggplot2 super-users](https://bit.ly/ggextend-cowy).

I've also grateful to colleagues at West Point Math Department for their feedback on my talk about creating and using new Stats objects: ['Unlocking ggplot2 as a computational engine by extending ggplot2 statistical geometries'](https://evamaerey.github.io/mytidytuesday/2022-05-09-statistical-geometries/statistical_geometries.html#1)

Furthermore, I've gained feedback from participants evaluating a new tutorial to Stat extension, [easy geom (Stat) recipes](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/easy-geom-recipes). A survey and focus group was used to hear their reactions. In brief, I found that the recruited ggplot2 super users (regular users with several years of experience), either hadn't tried to enter the Stat extension space, or felt it was quite challenging. But there was a high success rates for new Stat creation using the new tutorial's recipes model. [Participant characteristics and tutorial evaluation can be found here](https://evamaerey.github.io/easy-geom-recipes/easy_geom_recipes_compute_group.html). West Point Cadet Morgan Brown assisted in writing the tutorial.

# proposal

ggplot2 is notable among R package, sometimes even sighted as a key reason for using the R language more broadly. Its elegance and flexibility, and track-record of being well-maintained makes it a attractive tool for analysts, journalists, educators and the like.

ggplot2 lets users 'speak their plots into existence'. Users identify requisite, orthogonal plot elements, name those elements and ggplot2 produces the described plot. The composition-based nature of ggplot2 is key to its usability and in turn its popularity.

However, sorely under-utilized are ggplot2 extension mechanisms --- and in particular, the creation and use of new Stats. I believe providing education for this mechanism that could take productivity and statistical storytelling with ggplot2 to new heights.

Base ggplot2, of course, makes a lot of Stats available to users. Any time we use `geom_histogram`, `geom_boxpot`, `geom_smooth`, etc, mercifully much computation is happens under the hood for users. Compute is defined in ggproto objects like `StatBin`, `StatBoxplot`, `StatSmooth` which are used in these functions and computation is done automatically.

When users create new Stats via extension, they access ggplot2's *general* capability as a computation engine. These users realize that off-loading a computational task to a ggplot2 extension function will save their future-selves or others from doing painstaking computational tasks as a prep step. Having designated Stats means that computation is enabled at the point-of-use: *within* the plot pipeline via a descriptive function (e.g. geom_point_means() could be defined to plot a point at the means of x and y), instead of requiring computation before starting to plot (and in this case the creation of a derivitive dataset). And that *scope* of the Stat computation can be modified blazingly fast, via the addition of a group aesthetic or faceting declaration.

> It may seem surprising, but creating new stats is one of the most useful ways to extend the capabilities of ggplot2. -- ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis

Unfortunately, relatively few ggplot2 users have managed to harness the power of this very useful mechanism. The reason for this is likely that dedicated educational material is quite limited. The topic has been covered by extension mechanism authors in works like [the ggplot2 extension vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/extending-ggplot2.html) and in [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 3rd Edition](https://ggplot2-book.org/extensions), but because they are a small part of a much larger topic. In helpful and notable [extend your ability to extend ggplot2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=uj7A3i2fi54) talk by Thomas Lin Pederson, it's time that doesn't allow for multiple examples which could help users to start recognizing and differentiating patterns for new Stat creation. I believe that more focused, sustained attention is required of educational materials that want to help ggplot2 users get into Stat creation.

<!-- and because there might be misconception about what is required to enter this space of creating and using new Stats -->

Of particular concern is that barriers to entry and a lack of education is preventing people that could be be particularly prolific and efficacious from making contributions in ggplot2 extension. People with heavy teaching or analytic reporting loads, for example, might not think they have the time-resources to dedicate to figuring out Stat extension since educational materials have been relatively sparse. But extension by such people could be game-changing for their own teaching or analytic work -- and could have further impacts should they share more broadly.

This comment speaks to the need for greater education in ggplot2 extension mechanisms.

I have fleshed out a plan for doing this and preliminary work on this with emphasis on Stats creation. After hearing XXX reflections, I decided she might be interested in this new work. Her response, used with permission, is encouraging.

Further development of these resources and broad dissemination is the goal of this proposal. By supporting this proposal, I think the XXX grant will help ggplot2 and in turn R shine even brighter!
